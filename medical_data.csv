Questions,Answers
1.   Why and how did I get diabetes?,"Diabetes occurs for a number of reasons, but the ultimate cause of the high blood sugar that characterizes the disorder is either deficiency of the hormone insulin or a combination of insulin deficiency and resistance of the body tissues to its actions. In response to food intake, insulin is released by specialized cells in the pancreas and is necessary for adequate amounts of glucose and other nutrients from food to be absorbed into certain tissues of the body. When insulin is lacking or the body resists its actions, the level of glucose in the blood becomes excessively high and diabetes is diagnosed. The difference in the balance between the two characterizes the two major forms of diabetes—type 1 and type 2"
2.   What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?,"Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are two distinct forms of diabetes, each with its own causes, characteristics, and management approaches. Here are the key differences between them:Type 1 Diabetes: This is an autoimmune condition. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The exact cause of this autoimmune response is not fully understood but is believed to involve genetic and environmental factors.Type 2 Diabetes: This form of diabetes is primarily linked to lifestyle and genetics. It often develops in people who are overweight or obese and have a family history of diabetes. Insulin resistance, where the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin, and a relative lack of insulin production are characteristic of Type 2 diabetes."
3.   Can diabetes be cured?,"In general, we do not consider that diabetes can be cured once it has been diagnosed. People with type 2 diabetes can reverse the detectable abnormalities of diabetes by lifestyle adjustment without the use of medications."
4.   Is there such a thing as borderline diabetes? What is it?,The term borderline diabetes has now been replaced by the term prediabetes. Both terms indicate that a person has abnormalities in his or her plasma glucose levels that fall short of standard accepted definitions for frank diabetes.
5.   What’s the normal glucose level for a diabetic patient?,"Fasting blood sugar levels less than 100mg/dL is normal. Reading between 100 and 125 mg/dL is borderline (called pre-diabetes). 126 mg/dL and above signals diabetes.Postprandial blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is normal. Reading between 141 and 200mg/dL is borderline or pre-diabetes. 200 mg/dL and above signals diabetes.Besides, a random blood sugar test – irrespective of when you last ate – should always be less than 200 mg/dL.

Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.VEGETABLES (2½ to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day)Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetablesinclude dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.FRUITS (1½ to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day)Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day) There are 2 types of grains:Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast.PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6½ ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day)Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil.DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day)Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label.OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day)Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers,deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters)."
29. Can you tell me which foods and beverages I should avoid?,"When you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way  toward controlling your blood sugar and weight.Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:?    Food from all the food groups?    Fewer calories?    About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack?    Healthy fatsAlong with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often overweight or obese. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 60 total minutes of walking or other activity per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. Activity lets your muscles use sugar from the blood without needing insulin to move the sugar into the muscle cells.HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGARCarbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain yourenergy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestible carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains.MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETESMeal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow.

31. What activities should I include in my exercise plan?,"Warm up/cool down: The most important thing you can include in your physical activity regimen is a “warm up/cool down” routine for before and after your workout. The purpose of a warm up is to gradually prepare your heart, lungs and muscles for safe, effective and comfortable exercise. Warm up exercises include stretching or walking.Cool down exercises are important to lower your heart rate, body temperature and breathing rate to pre-exercise levels. A cool down exercise is one that reduces the intensity of your activity (for example, walking at the end of your jog); this gives the blood a chance to re-circulate throughout your body, and reduces your risk of fainting or dizziness. Read more about warm up and cool down exercises here.Resistance exercise is a very worthwhile activity for people with diabetes. Resistance exercises are ones that force your muscles to work repeatedly to overcome a resistance force. Weight lifting is one of the most common resistance exercises; others include push-ups and sit-ups. Thereason why resistance exercise is so important is that it builds muscle strength, as well as bonestrength and bone density. It has also been shown to help regulate your blood sugar levels, and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (the ‘good’ cholesterol)."

What are blood sugar levels?,"Your blood sugar levels, also known as blood glucose levels, are a measurement that show howmuch glucose you have in your blood. Glucose is a sugar that you get from food and drink. Your blood sugar levels go up and down throughout the day and for people living with diabetes these changes are larger and happen more often than in people who don't have diabetes."
Can I check my own blood sugar?,"You can do blood sugar level check by doing a finger-prick test, or by using an electronic blood sugar monitor called a flash glucose monitor or CGM. You can do this several times a day – helping you keep an eye on your levels as you go about your life and help you work out what to eat and how much medication to take.Not everyone with diabetes needs to check their levels like this. You’ll need to if you take certain diabetes medication. Always talk to your healthcare team if you’re not sure whether that’s you – they’ll give you advice on whether to check them yourself and how often.And there’s also something called an HbA1c, which is a blood test to measure your average blood sugar level over the last three months. Everyone with diabetes is entitled to this check.High blood sugar levels increase your risk of developing serious complications. However, you manage your diabetes, stay in the know about your blood sugar levels.To understand the methods of checking your blood sugar levels, Call now on 0800-66766 and talk to our certified healthcare practitioner for free."

Your healthcare provider will then easily track your sugar levels and suggest management that will help you lead a healthy lifestyle.But importantly, it will help you stay healthy and prevent serious diabetes complications now and in the future. By complications, we mean serious problems in places like your feet and your eyes. This happens because too much sugar in the blood damages your blood vessels, making itharder for blood to flow around your body. This can lead to very serious problems like sight lossand needing an amputation."

Things required for testing blood sugar levels?,"You’ll need these things to do the test:?    a blood testing meter?    a finger prick device?    some test strips?    a lancet (a very short, fine needle)?    a sharps bin, so you can throw the needles away safely.If you’re missing one of these, speak to your healthcare team and make a free call now on 0800-66766"
Blood testing meters,"New meters come on the market all the time, so it can be tricky choosing the right one. It’s best to ask your healthcare team for advice on a meter that’ll suit you.If you have sight problems, you may not be able to use some meters so your healthcare team can suggest alternatives.Some people can get meters on prescription. But if you choose to buy your own meter, you might not get a prescription for the test strips it uses. Chat to your healthcare team.For assistance call now on 0800-66766 and talk to our certified healthcare practitioner for free."
Test strips,Test strips usually come in batches of 50 and must work with the type of meter you’ve chosen.
Finger-prick devices and lancets,"Finger-prick devices pierce the skin with a needle so that a drop of blood can be taken for testing. The needle is called a lancet. You can adjust the device to change how far it goes into the skin. It’ll depend on the thickness of the skin.Lancets come in different sizes and thicknesses (or gauges). A higher-gauge lancet is thinner so is normally less painful, but it might not always give you enough blood. You can only use a lancet once or they get blunt and are painful to use.For assistance call now on 0800-66766 and talk to our certified healthcare practitioner for free."
How to do a finger-prick test?,"Your healthcare team will show you how to do it the first time, but these are the key steps:? Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Don’t use wet wipes as the glycerine in them can affect the test result. Make sure your hands are warm so it’s easier to get blood and won’t hurt as much.? Take a test strip and slot it into the meter to turn it on. Some meters will have tests strips built in.? Remove the cap from your finger prick device and put in a new lancet. Then put the cap back on and set the device by pulling or clicking the plunger.? Choose which finger to prick but avoid your thumb or index finger (finger next to your thumb). And don’t prick the middle, or too close to a nail. Place the device against the side of your finger and press the plunger. Use a different finger each time and a different area.? Take your meter with the test strip and hold it against the drop of blood. It’ll tell you if the test strip is filled, usually by beeping.? Before you look at your reading, check your finger. Use a tissue to stop bleeding, then use it to take out the lancet and throw it away in your sharps bin.?    By this time, your meter will probably show the result. Note it down.? You can use the same tissue to take out the test strip and throw that away too. Taking out the strip will usually turn the meter off.For assistance call now on 0800-66766 and talk to our certified healthcare practitioner for free."
What is an HbA1c test?,"As well as regularly testing your own blood sugars, at least once a year your healthcare teamwill ask you to come in for an HbA1c blood test. This checks your average blood sugar levels over the last three months and helps your diabetes team and you spot trends over time.This is one of your essential diabetes health checks and it’s really important you understand what your results mean. A high HbA1c means you have too much sugar in your blood. This means you’re more likely to develop diabetes complications, like serious problems with your eyes and feet. So it's really important to have this test regularly so that you can make changes and reduce your risk of getting complications.We’ve got more information about the HbA1c test and what your levels mean. Speak to our healthcare team and make a free call now on 0800-66766."
Make a note of your readings,"It  may  sound  obvious, but  you  must  record  your readings.  Note them  down  in  a  diary,  a notebook or in your phone calendar. Some meters have software that lets you do this.You and your healthcare team can then look back over your results to see if you need to adjust your treatment."
What's the normal range for blood sugar levels?,"There is a healthy range that you should ideally be aiming for, but your individual target range for your blood sugar levels may be different.You’ll get different readings at different times of the day, depending on things like what you’ve eaten and how much you are moving around. Here’s a guide to help you get started on finding your target range:"
If you’re a child with type 1 diabetes,when you wake up and before meals: 4 to 7mmol/l after meals: 5 to 9mmol/l

67. Could medications help protect my heart?,"People with type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke comparedwith those who don’t have diabetes—and at a younger age.Diabetes is among the strongest risk factors for heart and vascular disease. It’s right up there with smoking and having high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Having diabetes means you have too much sugar (also called glucose) in your blood. It can affect the way your heart works, and harm blood vessels. For example, the lining of the blood vessels may become thicker, which can impair blood flow. Many people have poor blood flow in their legs and feet, which can lead to numbness and weakness. Diabetes can damage other organs as well, including the kidneys.Diabetes and heart disease share many of the same risk factors, such as having high cholesterol, being overweight, not exercising and smoking.If you have diabetes, it doesn’t mean heart disease is bound to happen.

69. Why does nutrition matter?,"What you eat affects the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough of the hormone (insulin) that helps keep blood sugar in check or can't use it as well as it should. Because of this, your body can wind up with too much glucose, which leads to health problems.One of the most common health problems people with diabetes face is heart disease. Adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to die from heart disease or stroke as people without diabetes. Today, managing diabetes is just as much about managing your risk of developing heart troubles—or preventing problems if you already have heart disease.Proper nutrition and healthy eating can help. Think of your food as a central part of your routine to keep your body running well, just like any medications you take. The pillars of diabetes care include:?    Eating a healthy diet?    Exercising regularly?    Watching your blood sugar levels?    Taking your medications (if needed) Your nutritionist can guide you better."

72. Do I need to follow a special diet?,"Gone are the days of the one-size-fits-all, very restrictive ""diabetes diet,"" which focused on avoiding sugars altogether. Today, health care professionals recommend finding a healthy eating plan that fits your life.An eating plan helps to define the total calories you should consume and the amounts of different types of food—carbohydrates, protein, fats and so on—to include in your daily diet."
73. What kind of stress do people with diabetes face?,"A: People with diabetes face similar stressors as other people without diabetes, but due to their medical status they face additional challenges. Sources of stress can be both routine and nonroutine personal experiences as well as systemic issues of inequality, such as having to deal with racism within the healthcare system, inadequate health resources, or lack of access to basic food and shelter.People who have diabetes might also experience diabetes-related stress. This is a response to living with diabetes, which is a life-threatening illness that often requires chronic and intensive self-management and  awareness in regard to such things as medications and eating. Also, among people who have chronic illnesses such as diabetes, depression is more common, which is associated with poorer health outcomes."

76. What are the specific risks of stress for people who have diabetes?,"A: The type of stress can matter. If you look specifically at mental stressors, they can cause an increase in blood glucose levels for people with type 2 diabetes, but they can have a more variable response, either increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels, for people with type 1. Physical stress can increase blood sugar in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.The experience of stress might lead to unhealthy behaviors such as poor eating or smoking,which we know can lead to an exacerbation of diabetes-related health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and obesity. These conditions can make managing diabetes even harder."

These conditions can make managing diabetes even harder."
78. How can health care professionals help diabetic patients manage stress?,"A: Health care professionals can discuss with patients the impact of stress on health and why it’s important to manage it. They can engage with the patient about stressors they  might be experiencing and help them figure out ways to manage the stress. It’s important that health care professionals normalize the experience, by letting their patients know that everyone experiences stress, so they don’t feel bad for experiencing it.Health care professionals can also screen for diabetes distress and depression—this is recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). If you notice that your patient is struggling with any type of mental health difficulties, refer him or her to mental support as well. The ADA provides evidence-based  guidelines External link for psychosocial assessment  and patient-centered psychosocial care."
79. What specific guidance for managing stress is offered to diabetic patients?,"A: It’s three-fold: having conversations with your patients, referring them to or giving them resources, and encouraging them to join support groups so that they can educate themselves and have a network of people whom they can lean on for support. Being part of a group will help normalize their experience and provide a sounding board for their concerns.It’s important also to encourage patients to do brief exercises—for example, meditation or a quick body scan where you focus on each part of your body from head to toe—and to keep a journal in which they track their stress levels. These stress-reduction practices can be helpful for the health care professional as well, and it’s a great investment to learn them yourself, because when you are doing these practices on your own, it’s easier to talk to your patients about them."
80. How essential is diabetes education and support along with medications?,"Research shows that diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) can improve A1C levels and have a positive effect on other clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of diabetes."

83. Why should health care providers promote diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) for their patients with type 2 diabetes?,A: It’s important because over 90 percent of diabetes care is self-care; provided by the person with diabetes. Diabetes self-management education and support enables people to be the best self-managers possible.
84. When should that educational support be sought?,"First time point: At diagnosis, whether the person is on medication or not, to ensure that they understand their diabetes’ daily needs and to provide emotional and behavioral guidance for initial changes. We also want to start focusing on a healthy eating pattern that is individualized for that person.Second time point: During an annual assessment for education, nutrition, and emotional needs. This is a time to review, update, and provide additional support for all aspects of self- management.Third time point: When complicating factors influence self-management, such as a change in schedule or when a new disease detracts from one’s focus on the daily management of diabetes. For example, if a woman with diabetes is diagnosed with breast cancer, chemotherapy medication can affect her blood glucose, her desire to eat, or the taste of food. We can help her and others in this situation find a food plan that best fits them during this time and also adjust other aspects of their care so that they can continue to be confident in their diabetes management.Fourth time point: When transitions in care occur, such as when someone is transitioning from the hospital to home or from home to assisted living. These transitions can affect an individual’s activity or ability to function, and we want to be on top of that, while also attending to other adjustments that might influence daily choices."

87. What’s the evidence that diabetes education improves outcomes?,"Research shows that diabetes education improves the quality of life, self-efficacy, empowerment, healthy coping strategies, self-care behaviors, and adherence to the food plan. It also leads to healthier food choices, more activity, and use of glucose monitoring, and it lowers blood pressure and lipids. This is all referenced and cited in the article."

89. What's preventing everyone with diabetes from receiving diabetes education?,"ADA recommend that everybody should receive nutrition therapy from a qualified personand they should receive diabetes education. People living with diabetes need to have clear expectations for this, and the health system—including primary care providers—needs to make the referrals. Clinical systems management can help by providing automatic referrals at the four critical time points. Another barrier is that the referral to diabetes education must come from the primary care provider. It can’t be the cardiologist, for example, and the patient cannot self-refer."

92. How do you treat type 2 diabetes?,"When you have type 2 diabetes, you first need to eat a healthy diet, stay physically active and lose any extra weight. If these lifestyle changes cannot control your blood sugar, you also may need to take pills and other injected medication, including insulin.Eating a healthy diet, being physically active, and losing any extra weight is the first line of therapy. “Diet and exercise” is the foundation of all diabetes management because it makes your body’s cells respond better to insulin (in other words, it decreases insulin resistance) and lowers blood sugar levels.If you cannot normalize or control the blood sugars with diet, weight loss and exercise, the next treatment phase is taking medicine either orally or by injection.To get to know more information , Speak to our healthcare team and make a free call now on 0800-66766."

Multiple medications, also known as combination therapy is common in the treatment of diabetes! If one medication is not enough, you medical provider may give you two or three or  more different types of pills. Insulin or other injected medications also may be prescribed. Or, depending on your medical condition, you may be treated only with insulin or injected medication therapy.Many people with type 2 diabetes have elevated blood fats (high triglycerides and cholesterol) and blood pressure, so you may be given medications for these problems as well.To get to know more information about your current medications, Speak to our healthcareteam and make a free call now on 0800-66766."
"95. Can type 2 diabetes go away? And if my blood sugar becomes normal, do I still have diabetes?","Type 2 diabetes is a genetic condition or pre-disposition that doesn’t change with treatment. But diabetes is defined as an elevated blood sugar.When your blood sugar is normal with no treatment, then the diabetes is considered to have gone away. However, even when the blood sugars are controlled, because type 2 diabetes is a genetic condition, the predisposition for diabetes always exists. High blood sugars can come back.If you have type 2 diabetes and the blood sugar is controlled during treatment (diet, exercise and medications), it means that the treatment plan is working. You are getting the good blood sugar because of the treatment – NOT because diabetes predisposition has gone away. You will need to continue your treatment; otherwise, your blood sugar will go back up."

97. Will I need to take insulin if I have type 2 diabetes?,"Maybe. Historically, 30%  or  more of people with  type  2 diabetes required  insulin therapy. However there are many new drugs available that may delay or prevent the need for insulin therapy. It is expected that fewer and fewer individuals will need insulin replacement to control their blood sugars."
"94. As someone with type 2 diabetes, do I turn into a type 1 diabetic when I take insulin?","No. Taking insulin does not mean that you have type 1 diabetes. Your type of diabetes is determined by your genetics, not by the type of therapy."
"98. If I have type 2 diabetes and take insulin, do I have to take it forever?","Not necessarily. If you can lose weight, change your diet, increase your activity level, or change your medications you may be able to reduce or stop insulin therapy. Under certain circumstances, you may only need insulin temporarily – such as during pregnancy, acute illness, after surgery or when treated with drugs that increase their body’s resistance to the action of insulin (such as prednisone or steroids). Often the insulin therapy can be stopped after the event or stress is over."

100.           Will exercise help my diabetes?,"Exercise is very beneficial in the management of type 2 diabetes. Always consult with yourdoctor about exercise guidelines, to exercise safely and reduce risks."
101.           Do I need exercise to control my diabetes?,"Exercise is very beneficial in the management of type 2 diabetes. Always consult with yourdoctor about exercise guidelines, to exercise safely and reduce risks."
102.           If I have type 2 diabetes can I stop taking diabetes medications if I eliminate candy and cookies from my diet?,"If you eliminate concentrated sources of carbohydrates (foods that turn into sugar in your blood stream) like candy and cookies, you may be able to reduce or eliminate the need for diabetes medications. Everyone with type 2 diabetes will benefit from an improved diet, but you may still need other interventions, such as increased physical activity, weight loss or medications to keep your blood sugars in the target range. Check with your doctor about any diabetes medication dose adjustments that may be required if you change your diet."

106.           Are my children at risk?,"Yes. Type 2 diabetes is a genetic disease. The risk is highest when multiple family members have diabetes, and if the children also are overweight, sedentary and have the other risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your child has a 10-15% chance of developing type 2 diabetes when you have type 2 diabetes. And if one identical twin has type 2 diabetes, there is a 75% likelihood of the other twin developing type 2 diabetes also."
107.           Can my siblings be also diabetic ?,"Yes. Type 2 diabetes is a genetic disease.

And if one identical twin has type 2 diabetes, there is a 75% likelihood of the other twin developing type 2 diabetes also."
108.           Can Diabetes be prevented?,"Although we cannot change your genetic risk for developing type 2 diabetes, we do know that even modest exercise and weight loss can delay or prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. A landmark research study in the United States, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was completed in 2002 and showed that when people modified their risk factors for type 2 diabetes, they reduced their chance of developing the condition. Similar results have been shown in Finland.In the DPP study, people with pre-diabetes were enrolled and assigned to 3 different treatments:Intensive lifestyle changes – exercise (30 minutes, 5 days a week), a healthy diet, and weightloss (loss of 7% of initial weight)The diabetes drug, Metformin An inactive placebo disguised as MetforminThe group that made lifestyle changes was 58% less likely to develop diabetes compared to the placebo group. And the group that took Metformin was 31% less likely to develop diabetes compared to the placebo group. In other words – lifestyle changes and Metformin therapy can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes (weight loss, healthy diet and activity) are the most effective intervention."
109.           What are ketones and why do I need to know about them?,"Ketones and ketoacids are alternative fuels for the body that are made when glucose is in short supply. They are made in the liver from the breakdown of fats.Ketones are formed when there is not enough sugar or glucose to supply the body’s fuel needs. This occurs overnight, and during dieting or fasting. During these periods, insulin levels are low, but glucagon and epinephrine levels are relatively normal. This combination of low insulin, and relatively normal glucagon and epinephrine levels causes fat to be released from the fat cells. The fats travel through the blood circulation to reach the liver where they are processed into ketone units. The ketone units then circulate back into the blood stream and are picked up by the muscle and other tissues to fuel your body’s metabolism. In a person without diabetes, ketone production is the body’s normal adaptation to starvation. Blood sugar levels never get too high, because the production is regulated by just the right balance of insulin, glucagon and other hormones."
110.           What happens to my blood sugar levels when I’m stressed?,"During stressful situations, epinephrine (adrenaline), glucagon, growth hormone and cortisol play a role in blood sugar levels. Stressful situations include infections, serious illness or significant emotion stress.When stressed, the body prepares itself by ensuring that enough sugar or energy is readily available. Insulin levels fall, glucagon and epinephrine (adrenaline) levels rise and more glucose is released from the liver. At the same time, growth hormone and cortisol levels rise, which causes body tissues (muscle and fat) to be less sensitive to insulin. As a result, more glucose is available in the blood stream.When you have type 2 diabetes, low blood sugars from too much medication or insulin are a common cause of stress. The hormonal response to a low blood sugar includes a rapid releaseof epinephrine and glucagon, followed by a slower release of cortisol and growth hormone.These hormonal responses to the low blood sugar may last for 6-8 hours – during that time the blood sugar may be difficult to control. The phenomena of a low blood sugar followed by a high blood sugar is called a “rebound” or “Somogyi” reaction.When you have type 2  diabetes, stress may make your blood sugar go up and become moredifficult to control – and you may need to take higher doses of your diabetes medications or insulin."

Take one to two small steps today."
126.           Why and how can I get diabetes?,"Diabetes occurs for a number of reasons, but the ultimate cause of the high blood sugar that characterizes the disorder is either deficiency of the hormone insulin or a combination of insulin deficiency and resistance of the body tissues to its actions. In response to food intake, insulin is released by specialized cells in the pancreas and is necessary for adequate amounts of glucose and other nutrients from food to be absorbed into certain tissues of the body. When insulin is lacking or the body resists its actions, the level of glucose in the blood becomes excessively high and diabetes is diagnosed."
127.           What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?,"Type 1 diabetes is entirely due to an almost complete deficiency of insulin. The deficiency is the result of the immune system erroneously attacking and destroying the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. For the proper functioning of our bodies, it is necessary for insulin to be present at all times in the bloodstream and tissues, not only after we have eaten.Type 2 diabetes is due to a combination of our body tissues becoming resistant to the action of insulin and the inability of the pancreas to make enough extra insulin to overcome it. Although this latter component of the problem is often viewed as a failure of the pancreas, it is only in recent times, when our lifestyle and environment have caused many of us to become very insulin resistant, that the insulin-producing capacity is unable to compensate."
Hi,"Hello, I am DiBot, feel free to ask any question!"
What is diabetes,"Diabetes is a serious condition where your blood glucose level is too high. It can happen when your body doesn't produce enough insulin or the insulin it produces isn't effective. Or, when your body can't produce any insulin at all."
